Errors crop up in even the most experienced JavaScript developer's code. ESLint can help you catch these issues early and often; it gives you a heads-up when your JavaScript code might work, but isn't quite right. This popular tool highlights errors as you're coding and allows you to write and enforce custom rules. In this concise course—the first in the ESLint series—learn how to integrate ESLint into your workflow to customize automatic error checking. Instructor Sasha Vodnik steps through how to add ESLint to a project and configure it to examine code style and automatically populate your configuration with rules from a style guide. Plus, learn how to configure and use the ESLint extension for your code editor.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `01_03` corresponds to the first chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
